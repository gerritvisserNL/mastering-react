# React Counter App

A simple React application created using Vite to practice managing state and handling events by building a counter that can be increased or decreased.

## Features

- Increment the counter
- Decrement the counter
- Instant updates in the UI

## Tech Stack

- React
- JavaScript ES6+
- CSS
- Vite

## What I've Learned

While building this project, I have gained experience with:

- Using `useState` to manage state in functional components
- Importing hooks explicitly from React
- Handling events with `onClick`
- Understanding how React batches state updates
- Writing functional state updates using `prev => prev + 1` for reliability
- The difference between global and component-level CSS
- Structuring and rendering a simple React app
- Setting up a React project using Vite for fast development

## Possible Next Steps

- Enhance styling and layout
- Split components into smaller, reusable pieces
- Add extra functionality like reset, min/max values, or step sizes

This project is part of my React learning journey and serves as a foundation for building more complex applications using Vite and Next.js
